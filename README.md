🏗️ Project Overview
This is a sophisticated identity reconciliation system that demonstrates enterprise-grade full-stack development with modern DevOps practices. It's designed to solve the complex problem of linking multiple contact identities (email addresses and phone numbers) under unified contact records.

🎯 Core Functionality
Identity Reconciliation Engine
Smart Contact Linking: Automatically identifies and links contacts based on email/phone matches
Primary/Secondary Hierarchy: Maintains clean relationships where one contact is primary and others are secondary
Conflict Resolution: Handles merging when multiple contacts need consolidation
Real-time Processing: Sub-100ms response times for identity matching

📊 Database Schema
The system uses PostgreSQL with two main tables:

Contacts Table
Links contacts via linked_id foreign key
Supports primary/secondary relationships
Includes soft deletes and audit trails
Optimized indexes for email/phone lookups
Profiles Table
User authentication and profile management
Integrated with Supabase Auth
Row Level Security (RLS) for data isolation
🔐 Authentication System
Recently Implemented:

Supabase Integration: Professional-grade authentication
Multiple Sign-in Methods: Email/password + Google OAuth
Protected Routes: Authentication required for identity features
User Isolation: Each user sees only their own contacts
Session Management: Persistent sessions with auto-refresh
🎨 Frontend Stack
Technologies:

React 18 with TypeScript
Vite for fast development
Tailwind CSS + Radix UI for professional styling
React Router for navigation
React Query for server state management
React Hook Form with Zod validation
🔧 Backend Architecture
Node.js API Server
Express.js framework with security middleware
Rate limiting and CORS protection
PostgreSQL connection pooling
Transaction-based operations for data consistency
Health monitoring endpoints
Identity Algorithm

// Core reconciliation logic:
1. Find existing contacts with matching email/phone
2. Establish or identify primary contact
3. Handle multiple primaries (consolidation)
4. Create secondary contacts for new information
5. Return complete contact family tree
