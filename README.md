🏗️ Project Overview
This is a sophisticated identity reconciliation system that demonstrates enterprise-grade full-stack development with modern DevOps practices. It's designed to solve the complex problem of linking multiple contact identities (email addresses and phone numbers) under unified contact records.

🎯 Core Functionality
🔗 Identity Reconciliation Engine

🧠 Smart Contact Linking: Automatically identifies and links contacts based on email/phone matches

👑 Primary/Secondary Hierarchy: Maintains clean relationships where one contact is primary and others are secondary

🧩 Conflict Resolution: Handles merging when multiple contacts need consolidation

⚡ Real-time Processing: Sub-100ms response times for identity matching

📊 Database Schema
Contacts Table
Links contacts via linked_id foreign key

Supports primary/secondary relationships

Includes soft deletes and audit trails

Optimized indexes for email/phone lookups

Profiles Table
User authentication and profile management

Integrated with Supabase Auth

Row Level Security (RLS) for data isolation

🔐 Authentication System
Recently Implemented:
✅ Supabase Integration: Professional-grade authentication

✅ Multiple Sign-in Methods: Email/password + Google OAuth

✅ Protected Routes: Authentication required for identity features

✅ User Isolation: Each user sees only their own contacts

✅ Session Management: Persistent sessions with auto-refresh

🎨 Frontend Stack
Technologies:

⚛️ React 18 with TypeScript

⚡ Vite for fast development

🎨 Tailwind CSS + Radix UI for professional styling

🔀 React Router for navigation

❤️ Health monitoring endpoints

🧠 Identity Algorithm
Find existing contacts with matching email/phone

Establish or identify primary contact

Handle multiple primaries (consolidation)

Create secondary contacts for new information

Return complete contact family tree
